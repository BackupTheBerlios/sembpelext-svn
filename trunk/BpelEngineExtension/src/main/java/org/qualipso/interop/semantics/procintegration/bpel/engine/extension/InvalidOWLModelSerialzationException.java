/*
 * IST-FP6-034763 QualiPSo: QualiPSo is a unique alliance
 * of European, Brazilian and Chinese ICT industry players,
 * SMEs, governments and academics to help industries and
 * governments fuel innovation and competitiveness with Open
 * Source software. To meet that goal, the QualiPSo consortium
 * intends to define and implement the technologies, processes
 * and policies to facilitate the development and use of Open
 * Source software components, with the same level of trust
 * traditionally offered by proprietary software. QualiPSo is
 * partially funded by the European Commission under EU’s sixth
 * framework program (FP6), as part of the Information Society
 * Technologies (IST) initiative. 
 *
 * This program has been created as part of the QualiPSo work
 * package on "Semantic Interoperability". The basic idea of this work    
 * package is to demonstrate how semantic technologies can be used to 
 * cope with the diversity and heterogeneity of software and services 
 * in the OSS domain.
